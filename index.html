  <h3>Introduction</h3>
 
  <p id="one">
  Let us begin with a quick introduction in C. Our aim is to show the essential elements of the
language in real programs, but without getting bogged down in details, rules, and exceptions.
At this point, we are not trying to be complete or even precise (save that the examples are
meant to be correct). We want to get you as quickly as possible to the point where you can
write useful programs, and to do that we have to concentrate on the basics: variables and
constants, arithmetic, control flow, functions, and the rudiments of input and output. We are
intentionally leaving out of this chapter features of C that are important for writing bigger
programs. These include pointers, structures, most of C' rich set of operators, several controlflow
statements, and the standard library.
This approach and its drawbacks. Most notable is that the complete story on any particular
feature is not found here, and the tutorial, by being brief, may also be misleading. And because
the examples do not use the full power of C, they are not as concise and elegant as they might
be. We have tried to minimize these effects, but be warned. Another drawback is that later
chapters will necessarily repeat some of this chapter. We hope that the repetition will help you
more than it annoys.

  <h3>Types, Operators and Expressions</h3>
  <p id="two">
  Variables and constants are the basic data objects manipulated in a program. Declarations list
the variables to be used, and state what type they have and perhaps what their initial values are.
Operators specify what is to be done to them. Expressions combine variables and constants to
produce new values. The type of an object determines the set of values it can have and what
operations can be performed on it. These building blocks are the topics of this chapter.
The ANSI standard has made many small changes and additions to basic types and expressions.
There are now signed and unsigned forms of all integer types, and notations for unsigned
constants and hexadecimal character constants. Floating-point operations may be done in
single precision; there is also a long double type for extended precision. String constants may
be concatenated at compile time. Enumerations have become part of the language, formalizing
a feature of long standing. Objects may be declared const, which prevents them from being
changed. The rules for automatic coercions among arithmetic types have been augmented to
handle the richer set of types.
Although we didn't say so in Chapter 1, there are some restrictions on the names of variables
and symbolic constants. Names are made up of letters and digits; the first character must be a
letter. The underscore ``_'' counts as a letter; it is sometimes useful for improving the
readability of long variable names. Don't begin variable names with underscore, however, since
library routines often use such names. Upper and lower case letters are distinct, so x and X are
two different names. Traditional C practice is to use lower case for variable names, and all
upper case for symbolic constants.
At least the first 31 characters of an internal name are significant. For function names and
external variables, the number may be less than 31, because external names may be used by
assemblers and loaders over which the language has no control. For external names, the
standard guarantees uniqueness only for 6 characters and a single case. Keywords like if,
else, int, float, etc., are reserved: you can't use them as variable names. They must be in
lower case.
It's wise to choose variable names that are related to the purpose of the variable, and that are
unlikely to get mixed up typographically. We tend to use short names for local variables,
especially loop indices, and longer names for external variables.

  <h3>Functions and Program Structures</h3>
  <p id="three">
  others have done instead of starting over from scratch. Appropriate functions hide details of
operation from parts of the program that don't need to know about them, thus clarifying the
whole, and easing the pain of making changes.
C has been designed to make functions efficient and easy to use; C programs generally consist
of many small functions rather than a few big ones. A program may reside in one or more
source files. Source files may be compiled separately and loaded together, along with
previously compiled functions from libraries. We will not go into that process here, however,
since the details vary from system to system.
Function declaration and definition is the area where the ANSI standard has made the most
changes to C. As we saw first in Chapter 1, it is now possible to declare the type of arguments
when a function is declared. The syntax of function declaration also changes, so that
declarations and definitions match. This makes it possible for a compiler to detect many more
errors than it could before. Furthermore, when arguments are properly declared, appropriate
type coercions are performed automatically.
The standard clarifies the rules on the scope of names; in particular, it requires that there be
only one definition of each external object. Initialization is more general: automatic arrays and
structures may now be initialized.
The C preprocessor has also been enhanced. New preprocessor facilities include a more
complete set of conditional compilation directives, a way to create quoted strings from macro
arguments, and better control over the macro expansion process.
4.1 Basics of Functions
To begin with, let us design and write a program to print each line of its input that contains a
particular ``pattern'' or string of characters. (This is a special case of the UNIX program grep.)
For example, searching for the pattern of letters ``ould'' in the set of lines
Ah Love! could you and I with Fate conspire
To grasp this sorry Scheme of Things entire,
Would not we shatter it to bits -- and then
Re-mould it nearer to the Heart's Desire!
will produce the output
Ah Love! could you and I with Fate conspire
Would not we shatter it to bits -- and then
Re-mould it nearer to the Heart's Desire!
The job falls neatly into three pieces:
while (there's another line)
if (the line contains the pattern)
print it
Although it's certainly possible to put the code for all of this in main, a better way is to use the
structure to advantage by making each part a separate function. Three small pieces are better
to deal with than one big one, because irrelevant details can be buried in the functions, and the
chance of unwanted interactions is minimized. And the pieces may even be useful in other
programs.

  <h3>Constants</h3>
  <p id="four">
  
  An integer constant consisting of a sequence of digits is taken to be octal if it begins with 0
(digit zero), decimal otherwise. Octal constants do not contain the digits 8 or 9. A sequence of
digits preceded by 0x or 0X (digit zero) is taken to be a hexadecimal integer. The hexadecimal
digits include a or A through f or F with values 10 through 15.
An integer constant may be suffixed by the letter u or U, to specify that it is unsigned. It may
also be suffixed by the letter l or L to specify that it is long.
The type of an integer constant depends on its form, value and suffix. (See Par.A.4 for a
discussion of types). If it is unsuffixed and decimal, it has the first of these types in which its
value can be represented: int, long int, unsigned long int. If it is unsuffixed, octal or
hexadecimal, it has the first possible of these types: int, unsigned int, long int, unsigned
long int. If it is suffixed by u or U, then unsigned int, unsigned long int. If it is
suffixed by l or L, then long int, unsigned long int. If an integer constant is suffixed by
UL, it is unsigned long.
The elaboration of the types of integer constants goes considerably beyond the first edition, which
merely caused large integer constants to be long. The U suffixes are new.
A.2.5.2 Character Constants
A character constant is a sequence of one or more characters enclosed in single quotes as in
'x'. The value of a character constant with only one character is the numeric value of the
character in the machine's character set at execution time. The value of a multi-character
constant is implementation-defined.
Character constants do not contain the ' character or newlines; in order to represent them, and
certain other characters, the following escape sequences may be used:
